### Domain Background
Virtualisation of application environments and containerisation of applications is a trending topic these days. Different solutions are provided to virtualise an operating system or containerise an application and implement a cluster of nodes for managing / maintaining applications. One of the common topics within these clustering solutions is about distributing the load based on the available infrastructure resources ( for example processing power and memory ). For distributing the load, a component needs to keep monitoring the environment and provide the information to a scheduler to maintain the environment and organise future application deployments. The scheduler has an important role for improving and enhancing the environment or applications stability. One of the key metrics that scheduler has to consider is CPU utilisation. This project is going to look into providing a model for predicting the CPU utilisation. 

### Problem Statement
Improving the stability and performance of distributed applications a cross the globe is a challenging topic for enterprises. An application environment can get unstable when there is a heavy load on specific applications or nodes. Users often face high response time and low performance in case of any environment instability and this can have a huge impact on the branding or business of targeted enterprises and organisations. Today's competitive market requires organisations to provide stable and well preforming application environment to their customers, but providing such stability based on a limited visibility on utilisation of infrastructure resources is very challenging. On this project I'm focusing on improving the visibility of system metrics by providing a model for predicting the CPU utilisation based on the previous infrastructure monitoring records. Beside improving the stability, saving energy and costs are also other use cases on such mode.
